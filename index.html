    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm <strong>Cade Cowdrey</strong>, a Strategic Communications student at Pittsburg State University with hands-on experience across marketing, operations, and leadership.  
      From redesigning internal processes at Jake’s Fireworks to executing trade-show branding and leading campus organizations, I’m driven by the challenge of turning complex systems into efficient, human-centered solutions.  
      My goal is to keep growing as a communicator and problem solver who can connect brands, people, and performance in meaningful ways.
